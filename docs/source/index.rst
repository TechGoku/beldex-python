Python module for Beldex
========================

.. warning:: **URGENT SECURITY UPDATE**
   The version 1.0.2 contains an urgent security update in the output recognition code. If you're
   using the module for scanning transactions and identifying outputs using the secret view key,
   UPDATE THE SOFTWARE IMMEDIATELY.
   Otherwise you're safe. Standard wallet operations like receiving payments, spending, address
   generation etc. are NOT AFFECTED.

Welcome to the documentation for the ``monero`` Python module.

The aim of this project is to offer a set of tools for interacting with Beldex
cryptocurrency in Python. It provides higher level classes representing objects
from the Beldex environment, like wallets, accounts, addresses, transactions.

Currently it operates over JSON RPC protocol, however other backends are
planned as well.
